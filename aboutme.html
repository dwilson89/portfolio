			<h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2><hr>
			<h5>Development</h5><hr>
			<p>I am keen to practice and build upon my development skills. I enjoy creating software applications which can add simplicity to my daily life. For example I generally find it hard to decide upon something to watch, so I developed an application that would make, making a choice alot simplier as it was designed to give me a select few of many of my choices, helping to narrow my options. I have started exploring developing mods for World of Warcraft.</p>
			<h5>Sports and Other</h5><hr> 
			<p>I enjoy playing most sports, and have participated in athletics, soccer, football and cricket. However I spent the majority of my time playing club outdoor and indoor soccer. I am also an avid science fiction fan and a keen reader, as well as enjoying PC and consol game playing including World of Warcraft and Diablo 3.</p>
