			<h2>Interests and Hobbies</h2><hr>
			<h5>Development</h5><hr>
			<p>I am keen to practice and build upon my development skills. I enjoy creating software applications which can add simplicity to my daily life. For example, due to study commitments I have limited time for media however I also have a strong interest in current science fiction film and television. In order to reduce time and the distraction of choice I developed an application that was designed to provide me with a limited number of options from my vast library. I have also started exploring developing mods for World of Warcraft.</p>
			<h5>Sports and Other</h5><hr> 
			<p>I enjoy playing most sports, and have participated in athletics, soccer, football and cricket. However I spent the majority of my time playing club outdoor and indoor soccer. I am also an avid science fiction fan and a keen reader, as well as enjoying PC and consol game playing including World of Warcraft and Diablo 3.</p>
